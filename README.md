# Bite

Bite, a combination of 'byte' and bayit (בית) meaning home in Hebrew, is loosely based on the concept of 'iGoogle'. 

iGoogle is a former Google service that offered users with a personalized homepage on which they could set and use a selection of widgets. It was finally canceled in 2013.


Bite is my final project for the Developer Insitute bootcamp of 2023-2024.
